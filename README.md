# Digital Vision Assessment

This repository demonstrates a user management system built using the [NestJS framework](https://nestjs.com/) with TypeScript. It includes user registration, authentication with JWT, and other basic user management features, all set up and tested in a secure, scalable architecture.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with JWT-based authentication.
- **Biometric Login Support**: Integration for biometric key-based login (with hash verification).
- **User CRUD Operations**: Ability to create, retrieve, and manage users, along with conflict checks.
- **GraphQL Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with GraphQL for querying user data.

## Project Setup

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-project/repository-name.git
$ cd repository-name
$ yarn install
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure you set up your environment variables before running the project. Create a .env file in the root directory with the following (sample) configurations:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
```

## Compile and Run the Project

Run the project in different modes as needed:

```bash
# development mode
$ yarn run start

# watch mode (auto-restarts on changes)
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode (optimized build)
$ yarn run start:prod

```

## GraphQL Schema

The GraphQL schema for this project is autogenerated. An introspection file (introspectionSchema.json) has been added to my submission (and to this repository) for easy use with tools like Postman or GraphQL Playground. You can use this file to explore the available queries and mutations in the GraphQL API.

## Running Tests

Run all unit tests, end-to-end (e2e) tests, or check code coverage:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
$ yarn run test

# Run e2e tests
$ yarn run test:e2e

# Check test coverage
$ yarn run test:cov
```
